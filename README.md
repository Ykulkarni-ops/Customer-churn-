# Customer-churn-

The project consists of prediction of customer churn using machine learning using the available churn data. 
Here the data has been used to perform **data preprocessing, data visualization using tableau, data modelling and prediction.**

The project gievs good idea about the parameters that affect the churn and answers the following questions.

**1. Data cleaning including missing values, outliers and multi-collinearity. Describe your predictive churn model. How did you select variables to be included in the model?**\
**2. Demonstrate the performance of the model.**\
**3. What are the key factors that predict customer churn? Do these factors make sense?**\
**4. What offers should be made to which customers to encourage them to remain with company?**\
**5. Assuming these actions were implemented, how would you determine whether they had worked?**
